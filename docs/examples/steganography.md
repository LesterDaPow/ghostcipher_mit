# Steganography Examples

Advanced examples showing how to hide information in various types of text content.

## Email Communication

### Example 1: Secret Messages in Professional Email

```python

    email_body = """Subject: Q4 Budget Review Meeting
    
Dear Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to schedule our Q4 budget review meeting for next Wednesday at 2:00 PM in the main conference room.

Please bring your departmental reports and be prepared to discuss:
- Current spending vs. budget allocations
- Proposed adjustments for Q1 2024
- Resource requirements for upcoming projects

Looking forward to a productive discussion.

Best regards,
Sarah Johnson
Finance Director"""

## Practical Applications

### Tips for Real-World Steganography

1. **Keep secrets short**: Longer hidden messages are more detectable
2. **Use natural text**: Hidden content should blend with normal communication
3. **Consider the audience**: Only hide what recipients need to know
4. **Plan extraction**: Always know how you'll retrieve the hidden information
5. **Test thoroughly**: Verify hidden content survives copy/paste operations
6. **Layer security**: Combine with encryption for sensitive information
7. **Document lengths**: Keep track of secret lengths for reliable extraction

### Common Use Cases

- **Corporate communications**: Hide internal tracking information
- **Document management**: Invisible version control and metadata
- **Content marketing**: Track campaign performance and audience targeting  
- **Legal documents**: Add authentication and integrity verification
- **Customer support**: Internal ticketing data alongside public responses
- **Social media**: Analytics metadata and audience insights
- **Web development**: CMS tracking and content management data

## Next Steps

1. **Review [Best Practices](../guides/best_practices.md)** for secure usage
2. **Check [Advanced Examples](advanced.md)** for complex scenarios
3. **Read [Technical Documentation](../technical/architecture.md)** for implementation details
4. **Explore [API Reference](../api/ghostcipher.md)** for complete function documentation
